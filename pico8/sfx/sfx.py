"""The sound effects section of a Pico-8 cart.

The sound effects region consists of 4352 bytes. The .p8
representation is 64 lines of 168 hexadecimal digits (84 bytes).

Each line represents one sound effect/music pattern. The values are as follows:
 0    The editor mode: 0 for pitch mode, 1 for note entry mode.
 1    The note duration, in multiples of 1/128 second.
 2    Loop range start, as a note number (0-63).
 3    Loop range end, as a note number (0-63).
4-84  32 notes:
        0: pitch (0-63): c-0 to d#-5, chromatic scale
        1-high: waveform (0-7):
          0 sine, 1 triangle, 2 sawtooth, 3 long square, 4 short square,
          5 ringing, 6 noise, 7 ringing sine
        1-low: volume (0-7)
        2-high: effect (0-7):
          0 none, 1 slide, 2 vibrato, 3 drop, 4 fade_in, 5 fade_out,
          6 arp fast, 7 arp slow; arpeggio commands loop over groups of
          four notes at speed 2 (fast) and 4 (slow)
      One note uses five nibbles, so two notes use five bytes.

The RAM representation is different. Each pattern is 68 bytes, with
two bytes for each of 32 notes, one byte for the editor mode, one byte
for the speed, and two bytes for the loop range (start, end). Each
note is encoded in 16 bits, LSB first, like so:

  w2-w1-pppppp ?-eee-vvv-w3

  eee: effect (0-7)
  vvv: volume (0-7)
  w3w2w1: waveform (0-7)
  pppppp: pitch (0-63) 

The highest bit appears to be unused. In RAM, Pico-8 sets it for the 2nd
note in the pattern for some reason, but this is not written to the PNG.
